    <h1 class="textpoem">Fatal</h1>
    <p class="phpoem">
      
        BLESSED is the tree, which is barely sensitive,
        and more the hard stone because that one no longer feels,
        because there is no greater pain than the pain of being alive
        no greater sorrow than conscious life. <br><br>
        Being, and not knowing anything, and being without a certain course,
        and the fear of having been and a future terror...
        And the sure fear of being dead tomorrow,
        and suffer for life and for the shadow and for <br><br>
        what we do not know and hardly suspect,
        and the meat that tempts with its fresh clusters,
        and the grave that awaits with its funeral bouquets
        and not knowing where we're going,
        or where we come from!...

    <h1 class="textpoem">Caupolican</h1>
    <p class="phpoem">
        It is a formidable thing that the old race saw:
        sturdy tree trunk on the shoulder of a champion
        wild and battle-hardened, whose beefy mace
        brandished the arm of Hercules, or the arm of Samson. <br> <br>
        
        His hair for a helmet, his chest for armor,
        could such a warrior, from Arauco in the region,
        Spearman of the woods, Nimrod who hunts all,
        hamstring a bull, or strangle a lion. <br> <br>
        
        He walked, he walked, he walked. He saw the light of day,
        the pale afternoon saw him, the cold night saw him,
        and always the tree trunk on the back of the titan. <br> <br>
        
        «The Toqui, the Toqui!» cries the shaken caste.
        He walked, he walked, he walked. The dawn said: "Enough",
        and the high forehead of the great Caupolicán rose. <br> <br>

    </p>

    <h1 class="textpoem">To Phocás, the peasant</h1>

    <p class="phpoem">
        Phocás the peasant, my son, what do you have
in just a few months of life, so many
pains in your eyes that wait for so many tears
by the fatal thought that your temples reveal... <br> <br>

It takes time to come to this pain where you come from,
to this terrible world in duels and in terrors;
sleep under the angels, dream under the saints,
that you will already have life for you to poison yourself... <br> <br>

Dream, my son, still, and when you grow up,
forgive me the fatal gift of giving you life
that I would have wanted in blue and fresh roses; <br> <br>

because you are the chrysalis of my saddened soul,
and I have to see you, in the midst of the triumph you deserve
renewing the brilliance of my abolished psyche.. <br> <br>
